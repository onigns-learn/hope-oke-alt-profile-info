        <p>
          My name is Oke Hope Oghenetejiri, and I am based in Delta state, Nigeria.
          I hold a Higher National Diploma in Science Laboratory Technology from
          Delta State Polytechnic Otefe-Oghara, where I graduated with a
          distinction. I have worked as a <strong>Data Entry Clerk</strong> with
          Family Health International (FHI360) and a
          <strong>Bank Teller</strong> with the United Bank For Africa, gaining
          strong experience in data management, accuracy, customer service, and
          administrative support. <br />
          Beyond that, I am a fashion designer and the founder of
          <strong>HOBI CLOTHIER</strong>, a brand focused on couture and
          ready-to-wear outfits. More recently, I have expanded my skills into the
          <strong>virtual assistance space.</strong> <br />
          I am currently on the journey of transitioning into the tech world and by
          doing so, I am currently taking a frontend engineering course with
          <strong>ALTSCHOOL Africa</strong>, where I hope to gain the necessary
          skills and knowledge needed to be a frontend engineer, build connections
          with other tech people, and also gain mentorship. <br />
          Overall, I would describe myself as adaptive, service-oriented, and
          passionate about delivering excellence.
